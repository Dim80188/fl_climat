Instant access to science-ready imagery and intelligence from multiple data sources.

For decades, sensors have been collecting data about our planet. Yet complex global systems like agriculture, deforestation, water cycles, and many others, affect billions but are still poorly understood. Not only are these systems critical to understand for the good of humanity, they're also important for businesses as they adapt to — and attempt to thrive in — an ever-changing environment.

We are seeing an exponential rise in the number of real-world sensors, producing ever more data. Combining multiple sources provides a far richer view than that of any single data source. To harness this power and enable global-scale computation, it's necessary to have a data refinery that combines data from diverse sources, cleans it up and makes it ready for modeling - and a platform upon which to build living, learning models. That's exactly what we've built at Descartes Labs.

https://climatescape.org//organizations/ocean-minusbased-climate-solutions,Ocean-Based Climate Solutions,We restore the ocean ecosystem while naturally sequestering CO2 in the deep ocean.,"Using endless free ocean waves as the energy source, our ""Oxygenator"" upwelling/downwelling pumps bring up nutrient-enriched water to the sunlit upper ocean, triggering blooms of phytoplankton (single-cell plants) which must absorb dissolved CO2 to metabolize the nutrients. Forming the base of the ocean food chain, phytoplankton are consumed by higher trophic species, with the carbon-rich detritus sinking by gravity with some converted into long-term “recalcitrant” CO2 by the microbial carbon pump. The downwelling pump amplifies the down-flow of high-CO2 water below 600m depth where it is isolated from the atmosphere for thousands of years. 

When scaled-up across the open oceans far from land, up to 1,800 gigatons can be naturally sequestered by 2100 using this technology, at a cost as low as $6.30 per ton.

Funding will come from public corporations which gain strategic, financial, and marketing benefits by reaching net-negative CO2. Until now, these entities have freely emitted CO2 while providing products and services we all consume. The cost never was paid, so annual corporate earnings were overstated and accumulated on the corporation’s balance sheet. Our funding mechanism – Stock For Carbon – removes this excess valuation year-by-year as the corporation redresses its cumulative CO2 emissions and becomes cumulatively net-negative CO2. Not being paid in cash, the corporation maintains its working capital, preserving jobs, R&D, and growth. Shareholders initially are diluted but the improved sustainability results in higher stock price and ROI.

Our mission: Greenpeace is a global, independent campaigning organization that uses peaceful protest and creative communication to expose global environmental problems and promote solutions that are essential to a green and peaceful future.

Our History
A group of thoughtful, committed citizens came together in 1971 to create Greenpeace. A handful of determined activists leased a small fishing vessel, called the Phyllis Cormack, and set sail from Vancouver for Amchitka Island in Alaska. Their mission was to protest U.S. nuclear testing off the coast of Alaska with a brave act of defiance: to place themselves in harm’s way.

Despite being intercepted by the U.S. Coast Guard, these daring activists sailed into history by bringing worldwide attention to the dangers of nuclear testing.

Our Work
That was more than 40 years ago, and in that time, Greenpeace has indeed changed the world. And we continue to make the world a better place. Our committed activists and supporters have come together to ban commercial whaling, convince the world’s leaders to stop nuclear testing, protect Antarctica, and so much more.

Today, we have grown from a small group of dedicated activists to an international organization with offices in more than 50 countries. But our spirit and our mission remain the same. Our fight to save the planet has grown more serious—the threat of global warming, destruction of ancient forests, deterioration of our oceans, and the threat of a nuclear disaster loom large.

Greenpeace is actively working to address these and other threats.",Nonprofit,https://www.greenpeace.org/global/,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/greenpeace-romania,https://www.linkedin.com/company/greenpeace/,https://www.facebook.com/greenpeaceusa,https://twitter.com/Greenpeace

Today, the global supply of fertilizer is fueled by coal and natural gas and travels through a complex supply chain to farms around the world.  Fertilizer distribution is a hazardous and expensive process involving substantial storage and transportation infrastructure that stretches over thousands of miles.  As a result, fertilizer costs are inflated and farmers are often forced to make decisions based on prices rather than plants. Furthermore, entrenched supply chains often miss developing economies, so nitrogen is not available where it is often needed most.

Nitricity produces nitrogen fertilizer directly at the point of use. Our technology has the potential to produce cost-effective fertilizer for environmentally conscious farms, as well as for developing markets outside of traditional supply chain infrastructure. Removing the long supply chain allows farmers to apply fertilizers when their fields are ready, reducing wasteful runoff and maximizing nitrogen delivery anywhere in the world.",1-10,https://www.nitricity.co/,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/nitricity,https://www.linkedin.com/company/nitricity/,Нет данных,https://twitter.com/nitricityinc

Vision: Your personal CO2 emissions as accessible and actionable as your bank balance. 

TOGETHER WE TAKE THE FIRST STEP WITHOUT A FOOTPRINT
CarbonCancel is an initiative of 4 young entrepreneurs with an urge to tackle the big societal problems of our generation. Just like you, we are looking for ways in which we can make a difference.

We see a lot of people around us who care about our planet and have an irresistible urge to take responsibility for their own actions. We are also aware that it is not always easy to take tangible steps towards making your lifestyle more sustainable. People are not always able to renovate their homes or become vegan. However, that does not mean we should ignore the problem.

With CarbonCancel we want to give everyone the possibility to live a carbon neutral life. The first step is to become aware of where your CO2 actually comes from by calculating your personal footprint.

CONCITO is Denmark’s largest green network with nearly 150 companies, researchers, organisations and individuals as members of the CONCITO Council – each possessing extensive knowledge of climate change and leading in their field. The Council Members constitute the think tank and are affiliated to a number of working groups on specific topics, serving to enrich the development of new projects, analysis and dissemination projects.

CONCITO is financed partly by independent foundations and project partners. 

CONCITO is also involved in a number of international networks with other think tanks world wide who share the same purpose and profile as CONCITO, e.g. the World Resources Institute in the U.S., ZERO in Norway and the European Climate Foundation in the Hague.",11-50,https://www.concito.dk/denmarks-green-think-tank-concito,https://www.linkedin.com/company/concito/,https://twitter.com/concitoinfo,Нет данных,Нет данных

https://climatescape.org//organizations/kitepower,Kitepower,Developing the future generation of wind energy systems,"Technology has the power to transform how the world’s growing energy demands are met. Kitepower takes wind energy to a new level by replacing rigid constructions with smart controls and lightweight wings to produce cost-efficient and clean electricity.  We develop mobile airborne wind energy systems that make green electricity affordable for everyone.  

Kitepower is a commercial spin-off from the kite power research group of TU Delft and a first time industry applicant, currently funded by the EU Horizon 2020 Fast Track to Innovation Program REACH. 

When hearing about wind energy most people currently think of conventional wind turbines consisting of a tower with a heavy generator on top to which two or three blades are attached. While this design has grown in acceptance as much as it has is size, it comes with certain downsides. With increasing height, the costs for the tower rise exponentially and a sophisticated infrastructure for transporting the heavy components and assembling the power plant is required. Furthermore, the outermost part of the huge and heavy blades create the most energy. Airborne wind energy make use of this fact and significantly simplifies the design of wind based power generators. 

The concept of airborne wind energy replaces the tower by a lightweight tether which connects an airborne kite to the ground. Different shapes and materials are possible for the kite, from fixed wings like a glider airplane to completely soft wings as used by surfers. The kite itself is the equivalent to the blade tips in a conventional turbine. It flies in circles or figures of eight to increase the effective wind speed. Power generation with an airborne wind energy system is either realized by small turbines mounted on the wing or by a generator on the ground in a so called pumping concept. By removing the heaviest component parts from the system, this type of power plant is much more mobile in terms of location, and considerably cheaper in construction.",11-50,http://kitepower.nl,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/kitepower,https://www.linkedin.com/company/kitepower-bv/,https://www.facebook.com/kitepower.bv/,https://twitter.com/_kitepower

With a childhood spent playing in the seas of Brazil’s iconic Itúana beach, the ocean was part of his everyday life. Later, with a family of his own, witnessing the scale of destruction of our planet’s oceans became intolerable. Bernardo felt compelled to take action and play his part in turning the tide on this massive but solvable problem. Ocean Refresh was conceived.

We have big ambitions and a clear purpose – to rid our oceans of plastic. We will remove 2 million plastic bottles from our oceans by 2021, and turn them into stylish apparel & footwear. Making a long-lasting, positive impact for all living creatures.

By providing the same thermal insulation as conventional glass, along with the capacity to generate free clean electricity from the sun, it enables buildings to drastically improve their energy efficiency, decrease operation and maintenance costs, and reduce their carbon footprint.",51-200,https://www.onyxsolar.com/,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/onyx-solar,https://www.linkedin.com/company/onyx-solar-energy/,https://www.facebook.com/OnyxSolar,https://twitter.com/onyxsolar

“Open” refers to model source code that can be studied, changed and improved as well as freely available energy system data.

We believe that more openness in energy modelling increases transparency and credibility, reduces wasteful double-work and improves overall quality. This allows the community to advance the research frontier and gain the highest benefit from energy modelling for society.

Their influence in these areas of society has halted growth and stimulated climate inaction and denial for decades. Based on projections from the 2018 IPCC report, we must reduce emissions or risk warming above 2°C which would come with catastrophic impacts on ecosystems and people around the world. We’re far past the turning point. Negotiations have been less centred around changes and more around world leaders navigating loopholes, which is caused primarily by the fossil fuel industry’s lobbying tactics and immense influence and presence within these discussions. 

According to CDP’s Carbon Majors report of 2017, polluters like ExxonMobil Corp, Aramco, Gazprom OAO, Royal Dutch Shell PLC have been exerted 71% of global Carbon emissions since 1988.  Ironically enough, these polluters also have the greatest influence in nativating the direction of global Carbon Reduction agreements. This is blatant hypocrisy and even worse is allowing the companies who’ve led us into this crisis to pretend that they are the pioneers of solutions. The UN is allowing the fossil fuel industry to monopolize the energy industry in the future.That is why we are attempting to bridge together scientists and activists and indigenous people to kick fossil fuel out once and for all. Polluters Out is a global coalition of youth as well as adult allies and scientists that demand these polluters are out of indigenous lands, world governments, and are left out of the discussions at COP 26. While the fossil fuel industry has lobbied world leaders to benefit their own interests, this coalition is intended to be one where youth across the world lobby and pressure the UNFCCC and the Government of the United Kingdom to implement structural change to the framework in which these discussions operate. It is time the people who are facing the effects of climate change, whose lands have been exploited by the fossil fuel industry have a seat at the table, so that at COP 26 we can develop real solutions to the crisis we are facing, because we are out of time",Nonprofit,https://pollutersout.org/,https://twitter.com/pollutersout,https://www.facebook.com/polluters.out,Нет данных,Нет данных

We believe wind-farms can be beautiful, energy storage can be cool, and insulation can be inspiring - if we let go of the current focus on ‘design by spreadsheet’. If we do that, we can turn resistance into irresistible.  

We intend to apply this approach in our individual professional practices, but reality can move slowly. So that’s why we created Prototype 2030 - as a playground, where we want to give the world a taste of what’s possible. 

As much as we love this project, we hope it will be obsolete long before 2030.

---

Neighborhoods shape our lives. They are where we wake up each morning and go to work each day, where our children learn and grow, and where we spend time with our friends and family. Where we live can influence our health, our economic potential, and our children’s futures.

Everyone in America—no matter his or her age, ability, income, or race—deserves the option to live somewhere affordable, convenient, beautiful, and safe. And America’s towns and cities deserve investment, stewardship, and supportive, thriving communities. A smart growth approach to development is about creating the places that make this possible.

Smart growth means reinvesting in America’s downtowns and Main Streets, the economic engines of big cities and small towns alike. Smart growth means creating homes for families of all income levels alongside one another. Smart growth means diversifying our transportation system so Americans have a choice in how they get around. Smart growth means building streets that are safe for people walking, bicycling or using a wheelchair, as well as driving. Smart growth means reimagining the places we have already built, and protecting our open green spaces for generations to come.

Above all, smart growth is about helping every town and city become a more economically prosperous, socially equitable, and environmentally sustainable place to live. This approach looks different for every community, but can help neighborhoods of any kind flourish, make towns and cities competitive in a 21st century economy, and improve lives by improving neighborhoods.",Buildings,https://smartgrowthamerica.org/,https://www.linkedin.com/company/smart-growth-america,https://twitter.com/SmartGrowthUSA,Нет данных,Нет данных

It is mandated by the UN General Assembly to promote socially and environmentally sustainable towns and cities with the goal of providing adequate shelter for all.

Cities are facing unprecedented demographic, environmental, economic, social and spatial challenges. There has been a phenomenal shift towards urbanization, with 6 out of every 10 people in the world expected to reside in urban areas by 2030. Over 90 per cent of this growth will take place in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Caribbean.

In the absence of effective urban planning, the consequences of this rapid urbanization will be dramatic. In many places around the world, the effects can already be felt: lack of proper housing and growth of slums, inadequate and out-dated infrastructure – be it roads, public transport, water, sanitation, or electricity – escalating poverty and unemployment, safety and crime problems, pollution and health issues, as well as poorly managed natural or man-made disasters and other catastrophes due to the effects of climate change.

Mindsets, policies, and approaches towards urbanization need to change in order for the growth of cities and urban areas to be turned into opportunities that will leave nobody behind.

UN-Habitat, the United Nations programme for human settlements, is at the helm of that change, assuming a natural leadership and catalytic role in urban matters. Mandated by the UN General Assembly in 1978 to address the issues of urban growth, it is a knowledgeable institution on urban development processes, and understands the aspirations of cities and their residents.",1001-5000,https://wuf.unhabitat.org/,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/un-habitat,https://www.linkedin.com/company/un-habitat-united-nation-human-settlements-programme-/,Нет данных,https://www.facebook.com/UNHABITAT
